We need to make sure that the views that feedback to user via portal messages is
done correctly. Some views need to only show an error message if there was an 
AJAX error.

Translation issues:

* When assessment item is created correctly - portal message is in english:
  'Info - Item Created'

* Upon creating of assessment item the month of creating is in english as is 
  the workflow_state ('internally_published')
  30 January 2013 0 punte 0 minute internally_published

Validation messages need translating (while adding assessment items)
- Fout: there were some errors
- Required input is missing.
- When IRating Validator throw invalid it causes two portal messages to appear 
  (also untranslated)


Translation issues that ADMIN ONLY will see (thus perhaps do not need
translations if Admin will always use english?)
